# lonely-planet-analyzer
This repo documents my getting-to-know and playing with NLTK. At the moment, it is nothing but a collection of my notes and small experiments.
The goal is to analyze travel guidebooks' vocabulary and language structure, and potentially even create a Random Lonely Planet Headline Generator.
