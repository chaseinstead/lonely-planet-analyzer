# lonely-planet-analyzer
This repo documents my getting-to-know and playing with NLTK. At the moment, it is nothing but a collection of my notes and small experiments.
The goal is to analyze travel guidebooks' vocabulary and language structure, and potentially even create a Random Lonely Planet Headline Generator.

# to do
- build a corpus of lonely planets in order to analyse and eventually automatically imitate their vocabulary
- choose / build comparison corpora (e.g. other travel guidebooks, literature, speech)
